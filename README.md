# Piyopiyo

Piyopiyo (ぴよぴよ) is a C# implementation of foundation of [BVSP](https://github.com/hozuki/beatmap-visualization-server-protocol). The project is experimental.

**Status:** Suspended. I found [StreamJsonRpc](https://github.com/Microsoft/vs-streamjsonrpc) can achieve the same purpose (providing a JSON RPC 2.0 server and client), and it is more robust, maybe better designed. To be tested. BVSP component will be separated from the RPC core.
